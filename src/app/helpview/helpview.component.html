  <div class="flex flex-col gap-4">
    <p><span class="colorBlue font-bold">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
    <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).  <span class="colorBlue font-bold">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that  <span class="colorBlue font-bold">Join</span> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage.

            <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Exploring the Board</h3>
            <p>When you log in to  <span class="colorBlue font-bold">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>

        <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Creating Contacts</h3>
            <p>In  <span class="colorBlue font-bold">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flex gap-10">
        <h2 class="text-3xl">3.</h2>
        <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Adding Cards</h3>
            <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p>

        <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Moving Cards</h3>
            <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flex gap-10">
        <h2 class="text-3xl">5.</h2>
        <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-xl">Deleting Cards</h3>
            <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
                Remember that using  <span class="colorBlue font-bold">Join</span> effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.
